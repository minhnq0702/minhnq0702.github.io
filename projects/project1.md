## Project Overview

This e-commerce platform was developed to provide small to medium-sized businesses with a complete online shopping solution. The application features a responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Details

The frontend was built with React, utilizing Redux for state management and styled-components for the UI. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. User authentication is handled using JWT tokens, and all sensitive data is encrypted.

Payment processing is integrated through the Stripe API, ensuring secure transactions. The platform also includes an admin dashboard for managing products, orders, and customer data.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me valuable lessons about handling concurrent user sessions, implementing secure payment gateways, and optimizing database queries for performance. I also gained experience in creating an intuitive admin interface that simplifies inventory management for non-technical users.
