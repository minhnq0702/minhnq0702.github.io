title: AI Chatbot
description: An intelligent chatbot for customer service automation that uses natural language processing to understand and respond to user queries.
technologies: 
  - Python
  - TensorFlow
  - Flask
  - MongoDB
  - Docker
features:
  - Natural language understanding and processing
  - Context-aware conversations
  - Integration with knowledge base systems
  - Multi-language support
  - Analytics dashboard for conversation insights
  - Easy integration with websites and messaging platforms
challenges: The biggest challenge was training the model to understand context in multi-turn conversations. I implemented a context window mechanism that maintains conversation history and uses attention mechanisms to reference previous exchanges when generating responses.

## Project Overview

This AI-powered chatbot was developed to automate customer service interactions for a retail company. The system can handle common customer inquiries, process simple requests, and escalate complex issues to human agents when necessary.

## Technical Details

The chatbot is built using Python with TensorFlow for the natural language processing components. It employs a combination of pre-trained language models and custom-trained models specific to the client's domain. The backend API is developed with Flask, and all conversation data is stored in MongoDB.

The system is containerized using Docker for easy deployment across different environments. It includes a REST API that allows for integration with websites, mobile apps, and popular messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.

## Lessons Learned

This project provided valuable experience in natural language processing and machine learning model training. I learned how to balance model accuracy with response time, how to implement effective fallback mechanisms, and how to design conversational flows that feel natural to users.

The analytics component also taught me how to extract meaningful insights from conversation data, which helped the client continuously improve their customer service operations.
