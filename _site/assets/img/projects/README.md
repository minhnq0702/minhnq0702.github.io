# Project Images

Place your project images in this directory. For the best display on your portfolio:

- Use consistent aspect ratios for all project images (16:9 recommended)
- Use high-quality images (at least 1200px wide)
- Optimize images for web to reduce loading time
- Use descriptive filenames

The project1.jpg, project2.jpg, and project3.jpg images referenced in the projects.yml file should be placed here.
